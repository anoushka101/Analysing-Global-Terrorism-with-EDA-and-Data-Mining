# 🌍 Analysing Global Terrorism with EDA and Data Mining

This project investigates global terrorism patterns using the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**. By combining **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with **data mining techniques**, we aim to uncover regional trends, threat typologies, and actionable insights from decades of terrorist activity around the world.

---

## 📊 Objective

To understand the **evolution of terrorism** over time by answering:
- Where do most terror attacks occur?
- What weapons and tactics are most common?
- Which regions and groups pose increasing risks?
- Can we predict future attack patterns?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **K-means Clustering**, **Association Rule Mining**
- **Global Terrorism Database (1970–2017)**

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Cleaned and visualized global attack records.
- Analyzed geographical hotspots, attack types, and temporal trends.
- Identified key groups, weapons, and targets involved.

### 2. **Data Mining Techniques**
- Applied **K-means clustering** to detect regional risk patterns.
- Used **Apriori algorithm** for uncovering frequent attack combinations.

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan** were among the most affected countries post-2000.
- Bombings and armed assaults accounted for over 80% of all attacks globally.
- K-means revealed high-risk clusters tied to geopolitical instability.
- Association rules showed strong links between certain groups and attack methods.
